1. Running analysis of same transactions made with SWIFT and XRP
 - generating and taking data
 - feeding SWIFT and XRP logic and information of making transaction(fees, times, etc)
 - EDA of XRP vs SWIFT for same transactions

2. EDA where XRP can replace and help SWIFT, where it is better
 - building a model that will detect where XRP will outperform SWIFT 

3. Creating ETL pipeline and visualization dashboard in streamlit for banks to handle future XRP data.
 - building ETL library to handle XRP data

ETL to handle XRP data:

1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture, design, and implementation of two distinct ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for handling XRP blockchain data within a banking context. These pipelines are designed to process customer data and transaction data separately, providing a robust and scalable solution for data management and analysis.

2. Project Goals

Data Integrity: Ensure the accuracy and consistency of XRP data.
Data Enrichment: Enhance data with calculated fields and contextual information.
Data Validation: Implement robust validation rules to prevent data errors.
Scalability: Design pipelines to handle large volumes of data.
Modularity: Create modular components for easy maintenance and extension.
Visualization: Provide clear and informative visualizations of processed data and schemas.
User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive Streamlit application for data processing.
Separation of Concerns: Maintain separate ETL pipelines for customer and transaction data.
3. Architecture

The project consists of two primary ETL pipelines:

XRP Customer Data ETL:
Processes customer identity and account information.
Validates and standardizes customer data.
Generates schemas for customer data.
Provides download options for processed data.
XRP Transaction Data ETL:
Processes XRP transaction records.
Validates and transforms transaction data.
Enriches transaction data with calculated fields.
Generates schemas for transaction data.
Provides download options for processed data.
Both pipelines utilize Python, Pandas, and PyArrow (for Parquet) and are presented via a Streamlit web application.

4. Data Sources

Customer Data:
Parquet, CSV, or JSON files containing customer identity and account information.
Transaction Data:
Parquet, CSV, or JSON files containing XRP transaction records.
5. ETL Processes

5.1. XRP Customer Data ETL (xrp_customer_etl.py)

Data Loading:
Loads customer data from Parquet, CSV, or JSON files.
Data Validation:
Validates data against a predefined schema.
Performs data type conversions and format checks.
Handles missing data.
Data Transformation:
Standardizes address formats.
Schema Generation:
Generates a JSON schema representing the processed customer data.
Data Output:
Provides download options for processed data in CSV format.
5.2. XRP Transaction Data ETL (xrp_transaction_etl.py)

Data Loading:
Loads transaction data from Parquet, CSV, or JSON files.
Data Validation:
Validates data against a predefined schema.
Performs data type conversions, format checks, and range checks.
Handles missing data.
Data Transformation:
Calculates fiat amounts.
Categorizes transactions.
Data Enrichment:
Calculates transaction risk based on AML scores.
Creates transaction size categories.
Schema Generation:
Generates a JSON schema representing the processed transaction data.
Data Output:
Provides download options for processed data in CSV format.
6. Streamlit Application

User Interface:
Provides file uploaders for customer and transaction data.
Displays processed data in tabular format.
Visualizes data schemas in JSON format.
Offers download options for processed data.
Functionality:
Invokes the ETL pipelines based on user input.
Displays processing results and error messages.
7. Data Schema

Schemas are dynamically generated from the processed DataFrames.
Schemas are represented in JSON format.
Schemas include column names and data types.
8. Technology Stack

Python: Programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
PyArrow: Parquet file handling.
Streamlit: Web application framework.
Faker: Dummy data generation.
9. Implementation Details

Modular Design: ETL logic is encapsulated in separate functions for reusability.
Error Handling: Robust error handling is implemented to prevent application crashes.
Logging: Logging is used for debugging and monitoring.
Scalability: Parquet file format and efficient data processing techniques are used to ensure scalability.
10. Future Enhancements

Database Integration: Integrate with databases for data storage and retrieval.
Real-Time Processing: Implement real-time transaction processing.
Advanced Analytics: Add analytical capabilities for data exploration and reporting.
API Integration: Integrate with external APIs for data enrichment and validation.
Automated Testing: Implement automated unit and integration tests.
Security: Add security features to protect sensitive data.
KYC/AML ETL: Create a dedicated ETL for kyc/aml data processing.
